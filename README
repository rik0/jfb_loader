A very simple project whose only purpose is to load the dataset:
from:

```
@inproceedings{gjoka10_walkingfb,
 author= {Minas Gjoka and Maciej Kurant and Carter T. Butts and Athina Markopoulou},
 title= {{Walking in Facebook: A Case Study of Unbiased Sampling of OSNs}},
 booktitle = {Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '10},
 address = {San Diego, CA},
 month = {March},
 year = {2010}
}
```


into a Neo4J db.
